# Simple Calculator

A calculator implemented in Python that can perform various mathematical operations with error handling.

## Features
- Simple and easy to use
- Performs multiple arithmetic operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Power/Exponentiation
  - Square Root
  - Modulo (Remainder)
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Unit tests to ensure code quality

## How to Use
1. Run the script: `python calculator.py`
2. Choose an operation from the menu (1-7)
3. Enter the required numbers when prompted
4. View the result

## Running Tests
To run the unit tests:
```
python -m unittest test_calculator.py
```

## Learning Points
- Basic Python syntax
- User input handling
- Conditional statements
- Error handling with try/except
- Unit testing with unittest module
- Mathematical operations in Python

## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface
- Implement memory functions (store/recall)
- Add more advanced operations (trigonometry, logarithms)
- Add history feature to review past calculations
